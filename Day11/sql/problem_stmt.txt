You’re given a table website_events with the following structure:

Column Name	Data Type
user_id	INT
event_time	TIMESTAMP
page_url	VARCHAR
event_type	VARCHAR

Sample event_type values: view, add_to_cart, purchase.

Task:
For each user, find their conversion funnel in order —

first event_time they viewed something,
first event_time they added_to_cart after that view,
first event_time they purchased after the add_to_cart — all within the same session (say, within 30 minutes of each other).

Your output should be:

| user_id | first_view_time | first_add_to_cart_time | first_purchase_time |

Notes / Constraints:

All three events must be within 30 minutes of each other (view → add_to_cart → purchase).
If a user didn’t add to cart or purchase, show NULL for that column.
If multiple funnels exist, take the earliest complete funnel.
