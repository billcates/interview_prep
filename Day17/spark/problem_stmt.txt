You are given two huge DataFrames:

transactions_df

transaction_id
user_id
amount
timestamp

users_df

user_id
country

Task

Join transactions_df with users_df to get the country of each transaction.
But assume most users come from just 2â€“3 countries (e.g., US, IN), creating data skew during shuffle.

Compute the top 5 users by transaction amount per country in the last 7 days.

Optimize your solution for big data scale (hint: think about salting / broadcast / repartition strategies).
