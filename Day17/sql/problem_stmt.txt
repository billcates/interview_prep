You are given a table of employee job history. Sometimes, due to system errors, job periods overlap for the same employee.

Table: employee_jobs
Column Name	Type	Description
employee_id	INT	Employee identifier
job_id	INT	Job identifier
start_date	DATE	When the job started
end_date	DATE	When the job ended (nullable for current jobs)
Task

For each employee, detect overlapping job periods — cases where two jobs for the same employee overlap in time.

Output a table like:

| employee_id | job_id_1 | start_date_1 | end_date_1 | job_id_2 | start_date_2 | end_date_2 |

where the two jobs overlap.

Ensure you don’t duplicate pairs (if you output (job1, job2), don’t output (job2, job1)).
