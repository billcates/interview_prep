You have a table orders:

order_id	user_id	order_date	order_amount
1	A	2024-01-01 10:00	100
2	A	2024-01-05 12:00	150
3	A	2024-02-10 15:00	200
4	B	2024-01-02 09:00	80
5	B	2024-03-01 18:00	120

Task:
For each user_id and each calendar month:
Find the total order_amount in that month.
Compare it with the previous monthâ€™s total order_amount for the same user.

Output:

user_id
month (YYYY-MM)
monthly_total
previous_month_total
growth_percent ((current - previous)/previous * 100, NULL if previous is zero or NULL)

Requirements:

Only SQL
Should work even if a user has skipped a month (NULL previous).
Use window functions, not self joins.
