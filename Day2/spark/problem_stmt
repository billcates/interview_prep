You have a Delta table stored at:
/mnt/delta/orders/

Schema:

order_id (string)

customer_id (string)

order_date (timestamp)

order_amount (decimal(10,2))

Tasks:

Read the Delta table into a PySpark DataFrame.

Using a window function, find the top 2 most recent orders per customer (ties broken by order_amount descending).

Write the resulting DataFrame as Parquet to a new location /mnt/parquet/top_orders/ partitioned by customer_id.

Explain why you might partition the output by customer_id instead of order_date.
