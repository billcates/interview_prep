You have a CSV file /mnt/data/customers.csv with this schema:
customer_id (string)
name (string)
city (string)
signup_date (string, format yyyy-MM-dd)

And another CSV /mnt/data/orders.csv with this schema:
order_id (string)
customer_id (string)
order_amount (decimal with 2 places)
order_date (string, format yyyy-MM-dd)

Task:
Using PySpark:
Read both CSVs with an explicitly defined schema.
Join customers with orders on customer_id.
Filter for only the customers who signed up in the last 30 days.
For each city, calculate the average order_amount of these recent customers.
Write the result to Delta format at /mnt/delta/city_order_summary/, partitioned by city.
