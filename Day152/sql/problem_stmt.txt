Player with Longest Streak

You are given a table of tennis players and their matches that they could either win (W) or lose (L). Find the longest streak of wins. A streak is a set of consecutive won matches of one player. The streak ends once a player loses their next match.


For this question, disregard edge cases such as: players who never lose, streaks that start before the first loss, and streaks that continue after the final match.
