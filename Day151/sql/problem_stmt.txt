Cookbook Recipes

You are given a table containing recipe titles and their corresponding page numbers from a cookbook. Your task is to format the data to represent how recipes are distributed across double-page spreads in the book.


Each spread consists of two pages:


⦁   The left page (even-numbered) and its corresponding recipe title (if any).
⦁   The right page (odd-numbered) and its corresponding recipe title (if any).


The output table should contain the following three columns:


⦁   left_page_number – The even-numbered page that starts each double-page spread.
⦁   left_title – The title of the recipe on the left page (if available).
⦁   right_title – The title of the recipe on the right page (if available).


For the  k-th  row (starting from 0):


⦁   The  left_page_number  should be 2 × k.
⦁   The  left_title  should be the title from page 2 × k, or NULL if there is no recipe on that page.
⦁   The  right_title  should be the title from page 2 × k + 1, or NULL if there is no recipe on that page.


Each page contains at most one recipe and  if a page does not contain a recipe, the corresponding title should be NULL. Page 0 (the inside cover) is always empty and included in the output. Only include spreads where at least one of the two pages has a recipe.
