Youâ€™re given a streaming clickstream dataset where each user can click many pages in a session.
You need to identify user sessions using a 30-minute inactivity gap:

If the time between two consecutive clicks for the same user is more than 30 minutes, start a new session.

Assign a session_id per user for each session.

For each session, compute:

Total number of clicks

The first click time and the last click time

Session duration in minutes
