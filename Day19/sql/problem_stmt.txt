Youâ€™re given a table user_activity that tracks when users log in and log out. Sometimes users stay continuously active (back-to-back sessions), and we want to group such sessions into active streaks.

Table: user_activity
user_id	activity_date	event_type
1	2023-01-01	login
1	2023-01-02	login
1	2023-01-04	login
2	2023-01-01	login
2	2023-01-03	login
2	2023-01-04	login
Task

For each user, identify continuous active streaks of login days (no gap more than 1 day).
Output the user_id, streak_start, streak_end, streak_length.

Expected Output (from sample above)
user_id	streak_start	streak_end	streak_length
1	2023-01-01	2023-01-02	2
1	2023-01-04	2023-01-04	1
2	2023-01-01	2023-01-01	1
2	2023-01-03	2023-01-04	2
