You have a table page_visits:

column	type
user_id	int
page_url	varchar
visit_time	timestamp

Write a SQL query to:

For each user_id, find the previous page visited (the URL) before the current one.

Output columns: user_id, current_page_url, previous_page_url, visit_time.

If thereâ€™s no previous page for that user, show NULL for previous_page_url.

Results should be ordered by user_id and visit_time.
