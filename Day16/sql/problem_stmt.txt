Task

For each product_id, detect stockout events and compute how long the stock remained at zero (a “gap”) before it was replenished.
Inventory starts at zero unless otherwise stated.

Each row in inventory_movements is either:
an “in” movement (stock coming in)
or an “out” movement (stock going out)

You need to produce:

| product_id | stockout_start_date | stockout_end_date | days_out_of_stock |

stockout_start_date: the first day stock level became ≤ 0
stockout_end_date: the next day stock level became > 0
days_out_of_stock: difference in days between end and start
