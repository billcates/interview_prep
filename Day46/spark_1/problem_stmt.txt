Detecting Product Interest Windows”
🎯 Scenario:

You are given an event log from an e-commerce site.
Each row represents a user event like viewing or adding a product to the cart.

Column	Type	Description
user_id	string	Unique user identifier
event_time	timestamp	Time when the event occurred
event_type	string	One of "view", "cart", "purchase"
product_id	string	Product the event is associated with

You are asked to identify the "interest window" for each user-product pair —
the time between the first "view" and the first "purchase" of that product (if purchase exists).

If the user never purchased that product, ignore that product for that user.

✅ Requirements:

Compute, for each (user_id, product_id) pair:

first_view_time
purchase_time
interest_duration_minutes (difference between the two in minutes)
Only include rows where a "purchase" event exists for that product by that user.
Output should be sorted by interest_duration_minutes ascending.

💡 Example Input:
user_id	event_time	event_type	product_id
u1	2025-10-01 10:00:00	view	p1
u1	2025-10-01 10:05:00	view	p1
u1	2025-10-01 10:15:00	purchase	p1
u1	2025-10-01 11:00:00	view	p2
u2	2025-10-01 09:00:00	view	p3

💡 Example Output:
user_id	product_id	first_view_time	purchase_time	interest_duration_minutes
u1	p1	2025-10-01 10:00:00	2025-10-01 10:15:00	15
