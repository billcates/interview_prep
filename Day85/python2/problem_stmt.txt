Validate Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:


Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
