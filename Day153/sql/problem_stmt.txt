Best Selling Item

Find the best-selling item for each month (no need to separate months by year). The best-selling item is determined by the highest total sales amount, calculated as: total_paid = unitprice * quantity. A negative quantity indicates a return or cancellation (the invoice number begins with 'C'. To calculate sales, ignore returns and cancellations. Output the month, description of the item, and the total amount paid.
