Question: Product Affinity Analysis

You have an e-commerce table order_items:

Column Name	Data Type	Description
order_id	INT	Order identifier
user_id	INT	User identifier
product_id	INT	Product purchased
quantity	INT	Quantity purchased
order_date	DATE	Date of order

Task:
Find which products are most frequently bought together within the same order.
For each order, generate all unique product pairs purchased by the same user in the same order.
Count how many times each product pair occurs across all orders.

Output:

| product_id_1 | product_id_2 | together_count |

Rules:

product_id_1 < product_id_2 (no duplicates, no reverse pairs).
Only consider orders with at least 2 distinct products.
Sort the output by together_count DESC.
