App Feature Usage Tracking

You’re given two tables:

1️⃣ app_events
Column Name	Data Type	Description
user_id	INT	User identifier
event_time	TIMESTAMP	Time of the event
feature	VARCHAR	Which feature was used (e.g. search, chat, upload)
event_type	VARCHAR	Action type (open, click, exit)

2️⃣ subscriptions
Column Name	Data Type	Description
user_id	INT	User identifier
signup_date	DATE	When the user signed up
plan_type	VARCHAR	Free / Paid
🎯 Task

For each user and feature, you need to:

Time-Bucket the events into 15-minute windows based on event_time.
(Think of this as floor(event_time to 15 min).)

Count how many times the user used each feature in each 15-minute bucket.
Find the first time bucket when a user used a given feature after signing up.
Use subscriptions.signup_date to anchor the starting point.

Compute retention:

For each user & feature, find if they came back in the next 15-minute bucket to use the same feature again.
Return 1 if yes, 0 otherwise.

Output the following:

| user_id | feature | bucket_start_time | usage_count | returned_next_bucket | plan_type |
